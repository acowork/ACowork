/**
 * Local-network layer of the gateway connectivity module.
 *
 * The Gateway usually runs on THIS machine. When the laptop wakes on a
 * new LAN (Wi-Fi hop, sleep/wake), the persisted Gateway URL still
 * carries the OLD local IP — a black hole: every request hangs until
 * the OS TCP timeout while a perfectly healthy Gateway keeps listening
 * on the new address (2026-10-09 incident: 4+ minutes of silent
 * outage). This module records the "host was one of this machine's own
 * IPs" fact and, once the host stops being local, silently re-points
 * the URL at loopback (preferred — immune to any future network
 * change) or the machine's new IP. A truly remote gateway never
 * matches the hint, so it is left to the normal unreachable flow
 * (hint + candidate list, see `gatewayConnectivity.ts`).
 *
 * Silent by design: the product requirement is "just connect", not
 * "ask the user which of their own addresses to use".
