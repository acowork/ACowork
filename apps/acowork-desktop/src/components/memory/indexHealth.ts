/**
 * The Memory panel's "rebuild the index" banner decision, kept out of the
 * component so the rule itself is testable.
 *
 * Three conditions, in the order a user can act on:
 *
 * 1. The store declares a dimension the active model does not produce. The
 *    whole index is one rebuild away from matching the model.
 * 2. Some vectors are stored at a width the store does not declare. These rows
 *    are not missing - vector search skips a foreign-width row silently and
 *    says nothing - so no count of *missing* embeddings can see them, and a
 *    comparison of declared dimensions cannot either. This is the state a
 *    half-applied model swap leaves behind, and until now the panel was
 *    silent about it while reporting the store as healthy.
 * 3. Some memory nodes have no vector at all.
 *
 * `nodes_with_embedding` and `total_nodes` must be counted over the same set of
 * nodes, or condition 3 can never fire: conversation messages carry vectors but
 * are not memory nodes, so counting them made the comparison false on every
 * store with chat history.
