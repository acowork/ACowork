/**
 * Every sidebar that reserves the list-header band with
 * `--ui-list-header-h` must also draw a `border-b` on that band.
 *
 * Why a source scan instead of a render assertion: the consumers are five
 * unrelated components (SectionPane, DocTreeSidebar, ExtensionsView,
 * RightPanel, ProjectSidebar), each with its own store/mocks, and the
 * property is a single className on one element. Rendering all five just
 * to read a className is a lot of fixture for a one-line contract — and
 * the one case that actually regressed (pm, which had no `border-b`)
 * was invisible precisely because no test rendered that band.
 *
 * The contract: `min-h-[var(--ui-list-header-h)]` and `border-b` must
 * appear on the SAME line, since the band is a single element.
