/**
 * NodeGroupHeader visual contract.
 *
 * Two deliberate choices are pinned here because neither is visible to the
 * type checker and both are easy to "tidy up" back into place:
 *
 *   1. The permissions entry is a plain gear. It was a `UserCog` (person +
 *      cog), which reads as "manage a user" — wrong for a node, and
 *      inconsistent with the gear used for every other settings entry.
 *   2. The agent count is gone from the header row. It was the only thing
 *      forcing `ml-auto` onto the name, and the number competed with the
 *      online dot for the same attention in a 240px sidebar.
 *
 * Source scanning, not rendered DOM: AgentList pulls in the Tauri plugin
 * dialog, the gateway API and the agent store, so a render assertion here
 * would be brittle and unrepresentative. Same trade-off as
 * capsule.test.tsx — the markup IS the spec.
