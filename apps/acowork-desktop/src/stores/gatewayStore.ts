// ── Gateway liveness: single-authority model ─────────────────────────
//
// The MQTT CONNACK is the liveness authority: the broker runs inside
// the Gateway *process*, so a connack is sufficient proof it is alive.
// The HTTP `/health` probe is a subordinate *death classifier* — it
// runs only while MQTT is down, to distinguish "Gateway died" (fast
// refusal / reset / unreachable → `dead`) from "the path was cut"
// (probe answers, or no verdict at all).
//
// Invariants:
//   1. At most ONE probe in flight. A newer probe (or a CONNACK)
//      aborts the in-flight one; an aborted probe exits silently and
//      NEVER writes state — a superseded question must not pollute a
//      newer fact.
//   2. A timeout is NOT death evidence (the path may be black-holed,
//      which says nothing about the Gateway). Only a fast network
//      failure may declare `dead`, and only while MQTT is still down
//      (that is the classifier's licence).
//   3. `status` is a DISPLAY channel (ADR-051 semantics, read by the
//      banner / settings page). Connection gating reads the MQTT
//      authority — never `status`.
//
// The user-facing "unreachable" hint is NOT derived from the classifier:
// a gateway that stays non-connected for the connectivity module's
// budget (lib/connectivity/gatewayConnectivity.ts) is an outage the
// user must see and act on, whatever the cause (black-holed path,
// refused connection, dead process). The module debounces the MQTT
// authority into `gatewayUnreachable`; the classifier keeps producing
// its alive/dead verdict for diagnostics only.
