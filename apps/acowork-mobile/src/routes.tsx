/**
 * Route registry. Every screen the shell can render is registered here, so
 * the navigation contract is a single inspectable table rather than a set of
 * conditional imports scattered through components.
 *
 * A route that is reachable from a screen but missing here renders the
 * placeholder, which is why the list is kept exhaustive: the four tab roots
 * plus every second-level screen the design gives them (§2.2).
