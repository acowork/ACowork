/// Used by the Desktop `CreateWizard` to render a multi-select step
/// without having to maintain a parallel hardcoded list — the catalog
/// is the single source of truth shared with the Runtime
/// ([`acowork_runtime::tools::builtin::all_builtin_tools`]). The
/// `name` field matches the corresponding `Tool::name()` value, so a
/// wizard-selected name always round-trips through
/// `[[tools]] name = "..."` in the manifest.
///
/// The list is **static and exhaustive**: it intentionally covers tools
/// the Runtime registers conditionally (`codebase` needs LSP relay,
/// `rag_query` needs a RAG manifest entry, shell tools need a matching
/// binary on the host). Wizard-time we cannot know which of those will
/// actually be live when the agent starts; the Runtime already drops
/// unresolvable entries from `agent_tools.json` via
/// `init_tools_config_from_manifest` (only names present in the live
/// registry survive), so the worst-case effect of the user selecting a
/// tool that turns out to be unavailable is a silent no-op rather
/// than a manifest validation failure.
