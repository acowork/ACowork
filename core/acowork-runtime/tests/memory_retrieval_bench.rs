//! Realistic-store retrieval benchmark with absolute quality gates.
//!
//! ## Why this file exists
//!
//! The two archived benchmarks (`memory_m4_bench.rs`, `memory_m5_bench.rs`)
//! are before/after comparisons for specific ADR-062 decisions. They are sound
//! for that purpose and are left alone. Neither can answer "is retrieval good",
//! for two reasons this file fixes:
//!
//! 1. **Their corpus has exactly one relevant node per query.** Under the
//!    standard P@k definition (denominator = k) the Precision@5 ceiling is
//!    therefore 1/5 = 0.20 *forever*, however good the retriever is. The
//!    archived report's 0.80 was only reachable because `precision_at_k`
//!    divided by `min(k, returned.len())` - a system returning a single
//!    correct item scored 1.0. That is now fixed, so the old number is not
//!    reproducible and should not be quoted.
//! 2. **They assert nothing absolute.** The precision gate is
//!    `after.p5 >= before.p5`, a self-consistency check. A benchmark that
//!    passes at any level is a number nobody is obliged to read.
//!
//! ## What "realistic" means here
//!
//! A store shaped like an agent's actual memory, built from the transcripts of
//! two live Ponytail instances and the real knowledge nodes in their stores:
//! several durable claims per topic, so a query has a *set* of relevant nodes
//! rather than a needle in a haystack; near-duplicate restatements of the same
//! fact, which is what a store accumulates across sessions; topically adjacent
//! distractors that share vocabulary but answer a different question (the cases
//! that actually put junk into context); superseded restatements sitting in
//! Dormant; and unrelated filler, so filling the slots is a real decision
//! rather than a freebie.
//!
//! ## Three modes, because one number cannot be both reproducible and complete
//!
//! * **lexical** - BM25 alone, the fallback the runtime takes with no embedding.
//!   Deterministic on any machine, so this is the mode carrying the primary gates.
//! * **hybrid + live model** - the production path, fused over HTTP with
//!   whichever model the embedding service currently has loaded (asked from its
//!   `/health`, not hardcoded, so a model swap is measured instead of missed).
//!   Skips rather than fails where no model service is listening.
//! * **hybrid + identity-hash vector** - `procedural_embedding_fallback`, a
//!   semantically null vector. Reported, and asserted never to beat the lexical
//!   tier: an arbitrary second source must not out-vote a correct first one.
//!
//! ## The finding this file records
//!
//! The variable that dominates the vector tier is the encoder's language match,
//! not the fusion weight. Measured on this corpus of English sediment:
//!
//! | vector source           | Recall@5 | MRR   | nDCG@5 |
//! |-------------------------|----------|-------|--------|
//! | none (BM25 alone)       | 0.729    | 0.903 | 0.740  |
//! | bge-small-zh-v1.5 (512) | 0.688    | 0.774 | -      |
//! | identity-hash fallback  | 0.493    | 0.549 | 0.411  |
//! | bge-m3 (1024)           | 0.854    | 0.896 | 0.801  |
//!
//! The zh encoder did subtract from BM25: sweeping the fusion weight gave MRR
//! 0.33 at vector 0.8 (`Semantic`, the manager's default hint), 0.59 at 0.5
//! (`Factual`), 0.70 at 0.3 and 0.90 with no vector at all, because its
//! similarities collapse into a 0.44-0.69 band on short English sentences - the
//! anisotropy `manager::retrieve` warns about - and RRF let that noise out-vote
//! the lexical tier's correct rank-1. Switching to the multilingual model
//! removes the collapse: the vector tier now adds 12.5 points of Recall@5 over
//! BM25 alone while giving back 0.007 of MRR.
//!
//! Two things survive the swap. A semantically null vector still loses to BM25
//! by a wide margin, which is the assertion that keeps the fallback honest. And
//! MRR is still marginally better with no vector source at all, so the vector
//! tier earns its place by finding answers BM25 misses, not by improving the
//! ones BM25 already ranks first.
//!
//! Run with `-- --nocapture` to see the per-query report and all three modes.
