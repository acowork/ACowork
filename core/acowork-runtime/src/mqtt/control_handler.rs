//! MQTT control handler (ADR-033 Phase 3).
//!
//! Receives ControlCommand protobuf messages from the MQTT `control_rx`
//! channel and dispatches to the Runtime agent loop, following the same
//! business logic as `gateway_loop::dispatch_inbound()` (ADR-040).
//!
//! Protocol: `docs/zh/protocols/mqtt.md` §3.2, §5.2
//!
//! ## Message flow
//!
//! ```text
//! MQTT topic: acowork/agents/{id}/sessions/control/{cmd}
//!   ↓
//! RuntimeMqttClient (subscription)
//!   ↓
//! control_rx: UnboundedReceiver<(topic: String, payload: Vec<u8>)>
//!   ↓
//! parse DataEnvelope → ControlCommand
//!   ↓
//! match command:
//!   Intent            → push an intent into the agent loop
//!   ActiveHeartbeat   → renew the idle watcher's heartbeat deadline
//! ```
//!
//! ## Scope (ADR-076 §决策 4)
//!
//! This channel carries **no identity** — the broker has no per-topic ACL,
//! so it cannot attribute a publisher, and `ControlCommand` has no field to
//! carry one. Therefore **nothing user-initiated may travel here**: any
//! client on the broker could otherwise act inside another account's
//! session (including `approval_decision{approved:true}`, i.e. arbitrary
//! command execution). Every user-triggered session action — lifecycle
//! (create / open / close / delete / retitle / visibility / workspace /
//! config) and the action wave (chat / stop / continue / approval /
//! question_answer / cancel_tool / compress) — goes over the Gateway's
//! authenticated HTTP API. Their proto fields are *gone*, so they are not
//! merely rejected: they cannot be expressed.
//!
//! What is left is two signals that are not user actions and need no user
//! identity:
//!
//! - `Intent` — Gateway → Runtime (cron triggers, cross-agent messaging);
//! - `ActiveHeartbeat` — a presence beacon from the Desktop.
//!
//! ## Performance
//!
//! - Control commands (QoS 1): handled inline, not spawned
//! - Session events (QoS 0): fire-and-forget via `publish_session_event`
//! - `control_rx` is Unbounded → backpressure-safe
