//! ADR-087 §4 — the authorization module.
//!
//! One place that answers "may this caller do this?" for every
//! `/api/**` route. A route declares **two** things and nothing else:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! // what capability the route needs
//! Op::Use
//! // and which business entity it acts on
//! Resource::Session(agent_id)
//! ```
//!
//! The cascade, the visibility rules, the 404-vs-403 choice — all of
//! it lives here. A route that forgets to declare lands in the
//! default-deny arm and is caught by
//! [`tests::every_registered_route_declares_a_permission`].
//!
//! # The two dimensions
//!
//! **Capability** ([`Op`]) — `View` < `Use` < `Manage`. The ordering
//! is total and a route asks for the *least* it needs. These are the
//! three real tiers ADR-087 already defines, not an invented scale:
//! `View` is `can_view`, `Use` is `can_use`, `Manage` is `can_manage`.
//!
//! **Entity** ([`Resource`]) — `Node` / `Agent` / `Session`, cascading
//! `Node → Agent → Session`.
//!
//! # Cascade
//!
//! A lower tier can never exceed its parent. The requested capability
//! is threaded down and each level applies `min(its own ceiling,
//! what arrived)`:
//!
//! ```text
//! node view + agent use  +  request agent/use   → pass
//! node view + agent use  +  request session/manage → deny at node
//! node manage + agent view + request agent/view → pass
//! ```
//!
//! `min` rather than "the child overrides" is what keeps a *public*
//! node from silently promoting the agents installed on it: publishing
//! a machine says nothing about who may reconfigure a given agent on it.
//!
//! # What this module does NOT decide
//!
//! Session ownership. `SessionMeta::is_readable_by` /
//! `is_writable_by` in the Runtime (ADR-076 §决策 4) is already
//! implemented, already tested, and keyed on data the Gateway does not
//! hold. Re-deriving it here would be a second answer to one question.
//! So the Session tier here is a **ceiling**: it may lower a request
//! from `Manage` to `Use`, it never raises it, and the Runtime remains
//! the authority on which particular session the caller owns.
//!
//! Session-`*reads* (the session list) are a `View` read, gated by
//! `can_view` — a caller who can see the agent may ask for the list, but
//! the Runtime scopes it to the caller's own sessions (ADR-076), so a
//! non-granted caller sees an empty list and cannot create one anyway
//! (creation is a `Use` write, gated by `can_use`). The `Use` tier is
//! therefore the real wall for "may you drive this agent", not the read.
