//! ADR-087 — Node / Agent ownership policy stores (Gateway-side, fail-closed).
//!
//! Two persisted ownership tables live under `{data_dir}/`, mirroring the
//! "atomic-write JSON + in-memory mirror" pattern of the enrollment token
//! stores (`mqtt/enrollment.rs`):
//!
//! - `node_owners.json` — `node_id` (UUID v4, ADR-075) → [`OwnerRecord`]
//! - `agent_owners.json` — `instance_id` (UUID v4, ADR-073) → [`OwnerRecord`]
//!
//! Ownership is **Gateway policy data**, never echoed through the MQTT
//! data plane (ADR-087 D1): the Node's retained inventory stays the
//! existence authority, this table is the ownership authority.
//!
//! The decision functions below are the single source of truth for
//! `can_manage` / `can_use` / `can_transfer` (ADR-087 §4). Both the
//! permission middleware (`http/permission.rs`, 403/404 enforcement) and
//! the list/detail handlers (server-rendered `can_manage` booleans,
//! ADR-087 D8) call these — no client-side derivation, no drift.
//!
//! Fail-closed rule: a missing record means **ownerless** — only admins
//! can manage it (ADR-087 D7, upgrade migration).
