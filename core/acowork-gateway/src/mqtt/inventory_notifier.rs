//! Inventory-change signal publisher.
//!
//! Owns the `acowork/desktop/inventory` MQTT topic. Whenever the Gateway
//! mutates its aggregated `installed_agents` table (a Node reports a
//! freshly-installed package, a Node replays its retained inventory, or
//! the Gateway itself drops an entry on `DELETE /api/agents/{id}`), it
//! publishes a small signal on this topic.
//!
//! The signal carries no inventory data: the Desktop App (the only
//! subscriber today) fetches the authoritative list via
//! `GET /api/agents`, which combines `installed_agents` with the MQTT
//! AgentRegistry's liveness verdict. The signal just collapses the
//! previous 30 s `setInterval` fallback into a real-time push. Its
//! payload is a millisecond timestamp, purely so a human tailing the
//! broker can see *when* the change landed.
//!
//! ## Why a separate signal topic (not piggyback on `bootstrap`)
//!
//! `acowork/global/bootstrap` (ADR-059) is owned by the subsystem
//! orchestrator. Its `version` counter bumps only on subsystem readiness
//! transitions; inventory changes do NOT bump it. Smuggling inventory
//! signals through bootstrap would either (a) violate ADR-059 semantics
//! or (b) require an awkward `inventory_hint` field on `BootstrapState`
//! that the orchestrator has no business computing. A dedicated signal
//! topic keeps both contracts clean.
//!
//! ## Why `acowork/desktop/` and not `acowork/global/`
//!
//! Every Runtime subscribes to `acowork/global/#` and decodes each
//! payload there as a protobuf `DataEnvelope` (see `acowork-runtime`'s
//! `mqtt::available_cache::update_from_mqtt`). Anything on that prefix
//! that is not a `DataEnvelope` makes every Runtime log "Failed to
//! decode DataEnvelope from global resource topic" — once per inventory
//! change, plus once per Runtime boot. This signal is addressed to the
//! Desktop, not to the agents, so it lives outside the contract that
//! prefix carries.
//!
//! ## Why `retain = false`
//!
//! This is a change *event*, not state. Retaining it would hand every
//! later subscriber a hit it cannot distinguish from a fresh change, for
//! no gain: the catch-up is owned by the subscriber, which refetches
//! `GET /api/agents` on every MQTT (re)connect edge. That also covers the
//! case retention cannot — a change that happened before the broker
//! restarted.
//!
//! The payload is a timestamp rather than empty simply so the signal is
//! legible when tailing the broker; subscribers ignore its content.
