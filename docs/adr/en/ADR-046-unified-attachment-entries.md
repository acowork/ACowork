## Predecessors

- [ADR-021](./ADR-021-unified-session-data-loading.md) — unified session data loading path
- ADR-024 — per-session meta file + JSONL header removal
- [ADR-034](./ADR-034-mqtt-http-boundary.md) — MQTT / HTTP boundary (HTTP remains the document upload channel)

**Trigger**: a user uploads an image for the Agent to analyze. The analysis is correct, but
the conversation JSONL contains no trace of the upload at all; reopening the session
later loses the file, and the chat history shows no file icon. The three attachment
kinds (file upload, image upload, Add to Chat) each take a different, non-persisted
code path, and the `user` message gets polluted.

---

## 1. Problem

### 1.1 Current state (fact)

| Attachment kind | Entry point | Persistence result |
|---|---|---|
| File upload (PDF/DOCX/PPTX/XLSX) | `upload_document` HTTP → `<work_dir>/sessions/{sid}/documents/<doc_id>` + a `documents.json` sidecar index | JSONL gets one `metadata.type="document_upload"` system entry, but `filename` / `format` / `size_bytes` / `path` are all null — `gateway_loop` forwards only a `document_ids` string array and drops the metadata |
| Image upload (PNG/JPG) | frontend base64 → `content_parts.image_url` → `ChatMessage::user_multimodal` (**memory only**) | JSONL records **nothing**; the base64 is discarded after crossing MQTT |
| Add to Chat (file / selection / folder) | frontend `addAttachedContext` → `params.attached_context` → `build_attached_context_blocks` folds it into `enriched_content` | JSONL records **nothing**; it only lives in that one LLM request prompt |

### 1.2 User-visible consequences

1. After uploading a PDF and restarting the session, JSONL has a `document_upload` entry but all metadata is null
2. After uploading an image and restarting, the image is gone entirely
3. After Add to Chat on a selection/file and restarting, the context is lost
4. Chat history never shows an attachment icon (no separate entry type → no render branch)
5. After a restart the `user` message is folded back and complicated by `mergeDocumentUploads`, so it no longer matches the original input

## 2. Decision

### 2.1 Unified entries

**Every attachment is a standalone system entry in JSONL**, and the `user` message keeps
only the user own words. The attachment kind is distinguished by `metadata.type`:

```jsonl
{"id":"...","ts":"...","role":"system","content":"Uploaded file: report.pdf","metadata":{"type":"file_upload","document_id":"0123456789ab-3","filename":"report.pdf","format":"pdf","size_bytes":12345}}
{"id":"...","ts":"...","role":"system","content":"Uploaded image: screen.png","metadata":{"type":"image_upload","document_id":"0123456789ac-7","filename":"screen.png","format":"png","size_bytes":987654,"width":1920,"height":1080}}
{"id":"...","ts":"...","role":"system","content":"Attached: src/main.rs","metadata":{"type":"attached_file","abs_path":"/abs/path/src/main.rs","name":"main.rs"}}
{"id":"...","ts":"...","role":"system","content":"Attached: src/main.rs (L10-L25)","metadata":{"type":"attached_selection","abs_path":"/abs/path/src/main.rs","name":"main.rs","start_line":10,"end_line":25}}
{"id":"...","ts":"...","role":"system","content":"Attached folder: src/","metadata":{"type":"attached_folder","abs_path":"/abs/path/src","name":"src"}}
```

The `user` message always contains only the user's original words — except when there is
an image, where the base64 is injected into the LLM through `content_parts` for that one
request but is NOT written to JSONL (the image file itself is already on disk).

### 2.2 Unified file storage

**All uploaded files (PDF/DOCX/image/etc.) land in `<work_dir>/files/<doc_id>.<safe_ext>`**,
a sibling of `conversations/`. The extension comes from the `safe_extension` allowlist:
allowlisted formats keep their real extension, anything else falls back to `bin`.

```
<work_dir>/
├── conversations/
│   ├── <sid>.jsonl          # attachment metadata lives in the JSONL system entries
│   └── meta/<sid>.json
└── files/
    ├── 0123456789ab-3.pdf   # PDF — allowlist preserves the extension
    ├── 0123456789ac-7.docx  # DOCX — allowlist preserves the extension
    ├── 0123456789ad-1.png   # image — allowlist preserves the extension
    └── 0123456789ae-9.bin   # unknown format (exe/html/…) → falls back to bin
```

**Allowlist** (full list in `attachment_impl.rs::safe_extension`):

| Category | Kind | On-disk extension |
|----------|------|-------------------|
| Document | PDF | `pdf` |
| Document | DOCX | `docx` |
| Document | PPTX | `pptx` |
| Document | XLSX | `xlsx` |
| Image | PNG | `png` |
| Image | JPG / JPEG | `jpg` |
| Image | GIF | `gif` |
| Image | WebP | `webp` |
| Fallback | anything else | `bin` |

The allowlist logic MUST stay in lockstep with `detect_format` in the `doc_reader` tool
(`tools/builtin/doc_reader/mod.rs`). If a `docx` lands as `.bin`, `doc_reader` fails to
dispatch on the extension and reports "unsupported document format".

**Deleted**: the `sessions/<sid>/documents/` directory and the `sessions/<sid>/documents.json`
sidecar index, together with `load_documents_index` / `save_documents_index` /
`documents_dir` / `compute_doc_id`. File metadata no longer has a sidecar — **JSONL is the
single source of truth**.

**Add to Chat (`attached_file` / `attached_selection` / `attached_folder`) is not written
to disk**; only its address is recorded in JSONL. These are workspace files that already
exist on disk, so copying them is pointless and the only persistence cost is the path string.

### 2.3 Write timing

| Kind | Trigger | Write |
|---|---|---|
| `file_upload` | after `upload_document` HTTP returns, the frontend puts `{document_id, filename, format, size_bytes}` into `params.document_ids` | the backend `session_task.rs` calls `conversation.append_message_with_id("system", "Uploaded file: ...", metadata, doc_id_as_msg_id)` once it receives the `documents` param |
| `image_upload` | **new** `upload_file` HTTP endpoint (accepts any file, `content_type` inferred from the extension by default). The frontend may pass `width`/`height` back (desktop always does, a CLI might not); the backend schema tolerates them and omits them from JSONL when absent | same as above |
| `attached_*` | the frontend appends one system entry per item to JSONL in current order (before the user message) at send time | reuse `append_message_with_id("system", "Attached: ...", metadata, msg_id)` |

### 2.4 LLM input rework

**Delete** the `enriched_content` assembly in `session_task.rs:807-1100`: the
`<attached_document filename="...">...</attached_document>` doc_reader pre-extraction
blocks, the `[Attached context:] - file: \`path\`` block concatenation, and the
`The following workspace files were attached by the user...` block.

**Kept**:

- images → `content_parts` is injected into the current user message at `agent_loop.run()` (already the multimodal path, unchanged)
- files / selections → surfaced in `context_builder` as **structured references** (each `attached_*` becomes one `- file: \`path\` (L10-L25)` line so the LLM knows to fetch the content itself with `read_file`)

### 2.5 Rendering layer

`MessageBubble.tsx` replaces the single `document_upload` branch with five:

```tsx
if (message.type === "system" && message.metadata?.type === "file_upload")
  return <AttachmentChipRow kind="file"     filename={...} format={...} size={...} />
if (message.type === "system" && message.metadata?.type === "image_upload")
  return <AttachmentChipRow kind="image"    filename={...} format={...} size={...} documentId={...} width={metadata.width} height={metadata.height} />
if (message.type === "system" && message.metadata?.type === "attached_file")
  return <AttachmentChipRow kind="file"     name={...} absPath={...} onClick={openInEditor} />
if (message.type === "system" && message.metadata?.type === "attached_selection")
  return <AttachmentChipRow kind="selection" name={...} startLine={...} endLine={...} onClick={openInEditor} />
if (message.type === "system" && message.metadata?.type === "attached_folder")
  return <AttachmentChipRow kind="folder"   name={...} absPath={...} onClick={revealInTree} />
```

The unified `AttachmentChipRow` component uses icons `FileText` (file), `Image` (image —
thumbnail blob fetched from `GET /files/<doc_id>` then rendered via `URL.createObjectURL`),
`Hash` (selection) and `Folder` (folder). Single click: file/selection calls
`useFileEditorStore.openFile(agentId, workspaceId, relPath)`; folder calls `requestLocate`
plus `requestShowWorkspacePanel`.

**image_upload width/height**: when present in JSONL (desktop always sends it) they are
used as CSS dimension hints; when absent (a future lightweight CLI scenario) the `<img>`
`onLoad` reads the real dimensions as a fallback. **The rendering layer tolerates both paths.**

### 2.6 Deletions

| Location | Removed |
|---|---|
| `core/acowork-runtime/src/http/server.rs` | `UploadDocumentBody`, `upload_document`, `read_document`, `delete_document`, `DocumentEntry`, `DocumentsIndex`, `documents_dir`, `documents_index_path`, `load_documents_index`, `save_documents_index`, `compute_doc_id` |
| `core/acowork-gateway/src/http/proxy.rs` | `proxy_upload_document`, `proxy_list_documents`, `proxy_read_document`, `proxy_delete_document` + their routes |
| `core/acowork-runtime/src/agent/loop_memory.rs` | the whole `write_document_entries` function |
| `core/acowork-runtime/src/agent/session/session_task.rs` | the whole `build_attached_context_blocks` function; the `enriched_content` assembly at `session_task.rs:807-1100`; the doc_reader pre-extraction logic; the manual `file_summary` assembly on image upload |
| `core/acowork-runtime/src/startup/gateway_loop.rs` | parsing `documents: Vec<serde_json::Value>` → parse a rich object array `document_ids: Vec<{document_id, filename, format, size_bytes, [width, height]}>` instead (`width`/`height` are `Option<u32>`, absent means None; matched to the type field to write `file_upload` / `image_upload` respectively) |
| `apps/acowork-desktop/src/stores/chatStore.ts` | the `mergeDocumentUploads` function, the `document_upload` branch in `convertConversationEntry`, the `optimisticDocs` merge, the logic that strips the `documents` field onto the user message |
| `apps/acowork-desktop/src/components/chat/ChatPanel.tsx` | the `upload_document` Tauri command in `handleFileUpload` → replace with a generic `upload_file` (auto-detecting file vs image); `pendingFiles` stays as the uploading temporary state but is refilled from the persisted JSONL system entries right after sending; `optimisticDocs` is removed |
| `apps/acowork-desktop/src/components/chat/MessageBubble.tsx` | the existing single `document_upload` branch → replaced by the five `metadata.type` branches |

### 2.7 HTTP endpoints (kept and extended)

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `POST /sessions/{sid}/files` | upload any file (PDF/DOCX/PPTX/XLSX/PNG/JPG/...). `multipart` form `{file, content_type?, width?, height?}` (`width`/`height` optional — desktop always sends them, a CLI may omit them). Returns `{document_id, filename, format, size_bytes, [width, height]}` (the server echoes back whatever width/height it received; they are absent when not sent). **Saved to `<work_dir>/files/<document_id>.<safe_ext>`**. The backend does no image recognition, does not read the header, and does not depend on the `image` crate — it fully trusts the metadata the frontend passes |
| `GET /files/{document_id}` | download the file (auth passes through the Gateway proxy; the Tauri side uses this to load thumbnails). The implementation also falls back to reading `<document_id>` (the extensionless legacy filename) so historical data stays readable, though new writes no longer use the legacy path |

### 2.8 Extension allowlist (`<safe_ext>` resolution)

The `format` field of `upload_file` is a user-controllable lowercase string (it comes from
the extension picked by the desktop dialog filter). Concatenating it straight into
`<doc_id>.<format>` would let a hostile or accidental `format="exe"` land on disk where
Finder / Explorer treats it as an executable — that MUST be avoided.

`RuntimeAttachmentService::safe_extension` maps `format` explicitly onto an allowlist:

| Input `format` | On-disk extension |
|---|---|
| `pdf` | `pdf` |
| `png` | `png` |
| `jpg` / `jpeg` | `jpg` |
| `gif` | `gif` |
| `webp` | `webp` |
| anything else (including `""`, unknown, containing `/`, containing `..`) | `bin` |

**Key constraints**:

- the extension is always chosen by `RuntimeAttachmentService` itself and the user-supplied string is **never** trusted verbatim
- on-disk readability, replay, and `open -t` preview all follow this allowlist
- the `read_file` implementation accepts both `documents/<doc_id>.<safe_ext>` and the legacy `<doc_id>` filename (legacy fallback) so older developer-disk data stays readable

## 3. Final directory structure

```
<work_dir>/
├── conversations/
│   ├── <sid>.jsonl       # pure conversation + attachment entries (system role + metadata.type)
│   ├── <sid>.jsonl.lock  # existing file lock
│   └── meta/
│       └── <sid>.json    # ADR-024 per-session meta
└── files/
    └── <doc_id>.<safe_ext>  # all uploaded files (extension allowlist in §2.8)
```

## 4. Compatibility

**None.** The project is still in development, so no compatibility code is kept and no
migration script is written:

- old `document_upload` entries are not recognized (discarded)
- the old `sessions/<sid>/documents/` directory is left for the user to handle manually (to keep the data, the user copies or moves it to the new location themselves)
- the old `documents.json` sidecar index is deleted outright
- the old `mergeDocumentUploads` / `optimisticDocs` / `documents`-inline-into-user-message logic is all removed

## 5. Risks and rollback

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| On-disk filename collisions under heavy concurrent uploads | `<doc_id>` is the first 6 bytes (12-hex prefix) of `SHA-256(bytes)` plus bytes 6..8 (4-hex suffix) — **fully content-derived and stable across processes and restarts**. The birthday bound for a 48-bit prefix is ≈ 2²⁴ ≈ 16M blobs before ~50%, which is not a practical risk; if it ever happens the read path returns an `ambiguous on-disk match` error rather than guessing |
| The `files/` directory grows without bound over time | **out of scope for this round**, to be handled uniformly by a future document management feature |
| `MessageBubble` multi-branch regressions | one React test snapshot per each of the five `metadata.type` values |

## 6. Implementation breakdown

1. **Backend schema** (`conversation.rs` / `loop_memory.rs` / `session_task.rs`) — new metadata field types (`FileUploadMeta` / `ImageUploadMeta` / `AttachedFileMeta` / `AttachedSelectionMeta` / `AttachedFolderMeta`); replace `write_document_entries` to accept a rich object array; delete the `enriched_content` assembly.
2. **Backend storage** (`http/server.rs` + `proxy.rs`) — new `POST /sessions/{sid}/files` and `GET /files/<doc_id>` (**no DELETE**, left to a future document management feature); delete `upload_document` / `read_document` / `delete_document` / `documents.json`; change the on-disk path to `<work_dir>/files/<doc_id>`.
3. **Frontend send** (`chatStore.ts` / `ChatPanel.tsx`) — `sendMessage` gains an `attachedItems` parameter (from `sessionState.attachedContext`); the frontend only pushes `document_ids + attached_items` to the backend through params and the backend writes JSONL, which is simpler than having the frontend write system entries itself; `pendingFiles` / `pendingImages` stay as local upload state but are cleared right after sending; a unified `upload_file` Tauri command (auto-detecting PDF vs image).
4. **Frontend rendering** (`MessageBubble.tsx` / new `AttachmentChipRow.tsx`) — the five `metadata.type` branches; the `image_upload` thumbnail blob comes from `GET /files/<doc_id>` via `URL.createObjectURL`; the desktop frontend **always** sends width/height at send time (read with `new Image()`), and when JSONL carries them they are used as thumbnail CSS hints; a future CLI client may omit them and the rendering falls back to the real dimensions from `<img onLoad>` — **both paths are tolerated**.

## 7. Decision summary

- ✅ Reuse the `metadata.type` discriminant (same mechanism as `compaction`)
- ✅ `<work_dir>/files/` sits at the same level as `conversations`
- ✅ Files land on disk without a user-chosen extension (the kind lives in the JSONL metadata)
- ✅ `attached_folder` is not written to disk; only its address is recorded in JSONL
- ✅ No compatibility code and no migration script (old files are handled manually by the user)
- ✅ The user message always contains only the original words
- ✅ Image width/height are **optional** (`Option<u32>`): desktop always sends them, a future CLI may omit them; JSONL stores them tolerantly via `skip_serializing_if = "Option::is_none"`, and the rendering layer falls back to `<img onLoad>` when they are missing
- ✅ `files/` directory cleanup belongs to a future document management feature and is not implemented here
- ✅ `DELETE /files/<doc_id>` is not implemented; it is left to a future document management feature
